 This script is made to collect search results on europepmc website :
 User enters the search terms as arguments of the script, using the option 
 '--search-terms', or writes them in a file (url encoded beforehand, or using
 '--url-encode' option), given as an argument as well. The script makes the
 query on the website and returns the results on the standard output.
